The formal part of a customer relationship usually starts off with an estimate. With our systems we are able to send through an estimate via email in a matter of minutes. To make it easy, customers can then review it then approve it with just one click.
As an added bonus we can keep track of every time our customers click the link to the estimate. Sending invoices is just as easy. And once the customer makes the payment we log that in Freshbooks and automatically send them a predefined confirmation along with a simple «rate us» survey.

Of course Freshbooks comes with an iOS app so that you can always manage simple tasks, however you won’t be able to run detailed reports. You can, however,  track hours used on specific projects.
Freshbooks saves us a lot of time and makes us look very professional.
